        <h1>What We Do:</h1>
        <p>The goal of this application is to promote a cheap and accessible way for 
		students to buy and sell textbooks.  Stop getting ripped off by the bookstore 
		and start exchanging books here!  We dont actually deal with the transaction.  
		All we do is provide a platform for students to upload books and get in contact 
		with sellers.  Once you find the book you want, its up to you to agree on price, and 
		when/where to meet.  Enjoy. </p>
